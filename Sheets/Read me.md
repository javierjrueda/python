This script has been made for traking the time of different processes and people. 

You can define a bunch of processes and several names.

A macro, records the time of the day and the starting time when you press "Empezar". Once you click on "Terminar" you can see the time this process has taken.

If you have any doubt please, contact me at @javierjrueda
